Control System Design Project

## About
This report will focus on the design of a cruise control system working in conjunction with a controller that be automatically changing lanes. This project specifically aims to design a controller allowing the vehicle to:  
1. achieve any desired speed while still accounting for constant disturbances,   
2. discuss the effect of a system zero or when the vehicle is reversing ùë£0 < 0, 
3. change from one target speed to another and
